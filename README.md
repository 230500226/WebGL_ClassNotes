##### familiar with vary use within vertexShaderSourceCode - contains value within vertex shader and fragment shader
        
         - value of vary are same as attribute
         
         - value for var1 link to var2 inside main function

         - create varrying in frag and vertex shader with same name

         - allow for calculation of clour gradient between colours (top green, bottomL blue, bottomR red)
             - use precision for colour acc.
